# VSCCN
We propose a new method called VSCCN to classify the breast cancer subtypes via sprase canonical correlation analysis and deep learning tehnique on multi-omics data.
## In the SCCA-modelï¼š
  Run "running.m" to get the result of the sprase canonical correlation analysis of the mult-omics data.
  <br>"FGL-SCCA.m" is the function of sprase canonical correlation analysis.
  <br>"getNormalization.m" is the function to normalize the input data.
  <br>"updata--.m" is the function to iterate the weights.
## In the DNN-model:
  Run "binary-classification.py" to get the performance of binary classification of VSCCN.
  <br>Run "multi-classification.py" to get the performance of multi-classification of VSCCN.
